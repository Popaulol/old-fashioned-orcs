## "A Totally Generic Platformer"

Hello there! This is our project for the summer code jam of Python Discord!
"A Totally Generic Platformer" by Old-Fashioned Orcs, is a multiplayer game written in Python with [pygame](http://pygame.org).
The framework we chose to use for the client/server stuff is [`websockets`](https://github.com/aaugustin/websockets).
